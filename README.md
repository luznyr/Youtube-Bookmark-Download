# Youtube-Bookmark-Download
Just finished Codecademy course so thought I'd try make a script to download the youtube videos
which I had bookmarked. 
Majority based on youtube-dl (yan12125) and get_links (jabbalaci) I just added a couple of things.

To run, save bookmarks as html file in same folder as code, run "bookmarksave.py bookmarks.html"

Need to have youtube-dl and beautifulsoup installed (https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html and http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/#Download respectively)
